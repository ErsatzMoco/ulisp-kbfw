# uLisp KeyboardFeatherWing
A version of uLisp to convert Feather ARM boards with the KeyboardFeatherWing into a self-contained handheld Lisp computer.
It's based on uLisp T-Deck with some minor modifications: This version relies on the BBQ10 keyboard version by solder.party
and the ILI9341 display driver.
Currently tested with Adafruit Feather M0 and Feather M4 Express - SD functions not tested yet
